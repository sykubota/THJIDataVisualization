## Distribution of Work

Arguably, most of the work that went into the timeline was around gathering and cleaning up the data. We needed to do our own research to figure out what events we wanted to focus on in our timeline and then format that information to be concise and fit within the confines of the timeline.

Tasks:
Holocaust data research/wrangling
Japanese Internment data research/wrangling
Writing introduction
Tidying overall dataset
Timeline structure
Timeline and map side-by-side structure
Map implementation and debugging
Timeline tooltips 
Floating selector
Finding additional links/images
Linking timeline and maps (unfinished stretch goal) 

Due to time constraints, we were unable to complete our stretch goal of linking the timeline to the maps.
